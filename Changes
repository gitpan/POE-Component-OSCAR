Revision history for Perl extension POE::Component::OSCAR.

0.02  Wed Sep 22 14:27:00 2004
	- added "sleep 1" line to connection_changed as a hack to get it to work on
	  faster machines; though it's an unfortunate workaround, it appears to only 
	  get called once upon intial logon and once after signon success so all-in-
	  all it's not too devastating

0.01  Sat Aug 23 16:27:40 2003
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.22 with options
		-XA -b 5.6.0 -n POE::Component::OSCAR
